# ~ Fun & fresh doggos ~

## Running the app
Because you totally NEED this app running on your desktop background

## Thanks to
- Docker for creating a good starting point of a [tutorial](https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/beginner/chapters/webapps.md) (though note if you are following the tutorial you will need to make a few modifications - reach out to me if you have any questions)
- My mom for giving birth to me
- Dogs for keeping me happy
